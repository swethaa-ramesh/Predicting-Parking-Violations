# Predicting-Parking-Violations


## Overview

This project provides a data-driven solution for predicting parking violations in urban areas, particularly focusing on understanding spatial and temporal patterns. The dataset consists of 5 combined data sources from 6 months, covering information about parking violations, including fines, time, and location. The analysis was conducted using various machine learning algorithms and geospatial analytics to identify patterns, predict violations, and provide actionable insights for urban planning.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of parking violation records collected over a period of six months. It includes information on:

- **Violation Codes**
- **Time of Violation**
- **Location of Violation**
- **Fines**
- **Vehicle Types**
- **Issuing Agencies**
- **Coordinates (Latitude and Longitude)**
- **Other related features**

The data was cleaned, processed, and combined from multiple sources for the analysis. 

The dataset is available in the `combined_data.csv` file.
